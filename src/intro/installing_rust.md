# Installing Rust

_The following instructions are lovingly taken from the [Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)_

### Installing `rustup` on Linux or macOS

If you’re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```console
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the `rustup`
tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted
for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will appear:

```text
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

Additionally, you’ll need a linker of some kind. It’s likely one is already
installed, but when you try to compile a Rust program and get errors indicating
that a linker could not execute, that means a linker isn’t installed on your
system and you’ll need to install one manually. C compilers usually come with
the correct linker. Check your platform’s documentation for how to install a C
compiler. Also, some common Rust packages depend on C code and will need a C
compiler. Therefore, it might be worth installing one now.

### Installing `rustup` on Windows

On Windows, go to [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install][install] and follow
the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll
receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the C++ build tools for
Visual Studio 2013 or later. The easiest way to acquire the build tools is to
install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019][visualstudio]. When asked which
workloads to install make sure "C++ build tools" is selected and that the Windows 10 SDK and the English language pack components are included.

[visualstudio]: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

The rest of this book uses commands that work in both *cmd.exe* and PowerShell.
If there are specific differences, we’ll explain which to use.

### Updating and Uninstalling

After you’ve installed Rust via `rustup`, updating to the latest version is
easy. From your shell, run the following update script:

```console
$ rustup update
```
